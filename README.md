# How to use

**___I am still working on a way to edit everything outside of Discord Bot Maker___**

For the moment, i suggest that you download all of the file and use Discord Bot maker to view the whole project. You will then be able to see all of the variables and modify or add new variables

Modify the "/data/settings.json" Instructions are inside of the file
